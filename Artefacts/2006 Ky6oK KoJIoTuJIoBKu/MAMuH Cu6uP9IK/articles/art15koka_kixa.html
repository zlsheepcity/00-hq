			<h2>Five-star Kokalliku humiliate Kixa</h2>

<p><i>Imperious Kokalliku ran out confident winners against hapless Kixa at Viktor Onopko Arena this afternoon with Swiss international Frederic Dridi providing two goals in a 7-0 rout.</i></p>
 
<b>'Onopchas' chants</b>
<p>With fairly decent turn-out of faithful 'onopchas' chanting 'Gazzaev is a stinky dog' songs, Kokalliku took the match under control straight away with emphasis on five-man strong midfield ran by Anders Tornoe and Ragner Jepsen. However, it was right winger Ubaldo Asperti who broke the deadlock as early as 2 minutes when he made a fool of Mehdehem Eren before cutting into the penalty area to make it 1-0 to the delight of Roman Jarno.</p>
 
<b>Down goes the Floor</b>
<p>Kixa, fresh off a majestic 2-1 league win over FK Juventus, were not to be fazed by such a nightmare start, their centre-back Floor Lodeweyckx emulating the past forays of a player the stadium is named after when he dashed forward using seven-mile steps to get past eight markers but the eventual shot was easy prey for in-form Aris Grunde in Kokalliku goal.</p>
 
<b>The vicious Sipailo</b>
<p>While quite obviously referee was courted by Kokalliku officials before the kick-off, he did hesitate until 30 minutes to point to the spot, clearly aware that overconfident Jorge Renquin would place the ball into row Z of the stands. Yet even the vicious Arturs Sipailo, the whistleblower, could not expect Renquin to blast the ball so high and wide that it actually hit the statue of Viktor Onopko in the park outside the arena. Bogus.</p>
 
<b>Discussing the lineups</b>
<p>It was Dridi in the spotlight as half-time drew nearer and Kixa seemed to do their best to contain Kokalliku's creative, trash-talking midfield. The Swiss playmaker accelerated to get past Lodeweyckx and Sander van Erp as the defensive duo was distracted by discussing their Fantasy Football lineups and sliced home the second goal. Ragner Jepsen, much to the shock of travelling red-and-white support, added another goal after a brilliant rapid move down the wing. The away fans at this point rolled out a 'Suck some red-and-white dick' banner on the stands, much to the irony of the episode. </p>
 
<b>Defensive resolve</b>
<p>A dick Kokalliku would certainly suck, if not for Lodeweyckx who strode into the penalty area once again, but looked too busy dealing with an itch up his arse when he was applying the finishing touch. That goal, or rather that itch up the arse, seemed to have completely ruined Kixa's defensive resolve as again Dridi punished Kixa with a swerving, curling, upward, bouncing banana drive from the edge of the penalty area to make it 4-0. Man, you have to be a bit easier on those Bombardier's in the Dickens the evening before the match!</p>
 
<b>Surplus of talent</b>
<p>And into the gutter, and down the drain Kixa went - just like the night before, when they ended up in Rigonda night club grabbing some Purvciems arse and picking up an odd tussle with rednecks from Faraons. Kokalliku at this time were using their surplus of attacking talent to slice through Kixa defence like a Zwilling knife through Tukuma Sviests, with Anders Tornoe delivering the fifth.</p>
 
<b>Prophetic power</b>
<p>Kixa did have a brief return to life midway through the half, when Arjo Frijters, who quit drinking and had his liver removed a about a year ago, had a great chance to pull one back but missed by a country mile. Renquin then proved to Kixa the prophetic power of Vladimir Maslachenko, as he scored to add credibility to the principle of 'when you guys don't score, someone else will whip you'.  Then, again, sometimes it's a matter of who wins in the locker-room, and Kixa did not even wait for a final whistle as Jepsen was carried off on a stretcher. Kokalliku then for some reason thought that goals matter more than real manlike action and Johan Stjernborn cheekily scored the seventh just when 'onopchas' were expecting a fist-fight involving two teams. Cowards!</p>
